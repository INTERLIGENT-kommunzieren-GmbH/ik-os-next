# Releases and channels

## Channels (SDD §8)

    ghcr.io/interligent-kommunzieren-gmbh/ik-os:testing
    ghcr.io/interligent-kommunzieren-gmbh/ik-os:stable
    ghcr.io/interligent-kommunzieren-gmbh/ik-os:stable-previous
    ghcr.io/interligent-kommunzieren-gmbh/ik-os:<version>

`testing` is built on every push to `main` and weekly. `stable` is only ever
written by the **Promote testing to stable** workflow, which requires a
reviewer approval and a hardware-validation ticket reference, and which copies
the outgoing stable image to `stable-previous` first so rollback stays possible
(SDD §8).

Versions look like `testing.20260823.42` — channel, build date, run number.
Deployments should pin by digest where possible (SDD §7).

## What every release records (SDD §41, §46)

`/usr/share/ik-os/release.env` in the image, and the workflow artefacts:

- OCI image digest
- source git commit
- resolved Debian codename and point release
- kernel package version and release
- bootc, composefs and ostree versions (ostree is a pinned upstream build, not
  the Debian package — see ADR 0001)
- Secure Boot signing state
- `packages.manifest` — every package and version
- `ik-os.spdx.json` — SBOM, attested to the image with cosign

## Debian release transitions (SDD §47)

The image tracks the floating `stable` suite. `build/scripts/00-preflight.sh`
compares what `stable` resolved to against `EXPECTED_DEBIAN_CODENAME` in
`config/image.env` and **fails the build** when they differ.

That failure is the point: it turns a silent major-release transition into a
red build. Bump `EXPECTED_DEBIAN_CODENAME` only alongside an approved
release-transition ticket and a full hardware validation pass.

## Kernel promotion (SDD §9)

Kernel updates enter `testing` first. A kernel reaches `stable` only after
`tests/hardware/test-hardware.sh` has been run and signed off on every hardware
class in `docs/hardware.md`.
